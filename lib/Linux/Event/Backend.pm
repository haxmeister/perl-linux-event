=head1 NAME

Linux::Event::Backend - Backend contract for Linux::Event::Loop

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module documents the minimal backend interface expected by
L<Linux::Event::Loop>. Backends are intentionally duck-typed.

The loop owns scheduling policy (clock/timer/scheduler). The backend owns the
wait/dispatch mechanism (epoll now, io_uring later).

=head1 STATUS

As of version 0.005_004, the backend contract described here is considered stable.
New optional methods may be added in future releases, but required methods and callback ABI
will not change.

=head1 REQUIRED METHODS

=head2 new(%args)

Create the backend instance.

=head2 watch($fh, $mask, $cb, %opt) -> $fd

Register a filehandle for readiness notifications.

Callback signature (standardized by this project):

  $cb->($loop, $fh, $fd, $mask, $tag);

Where:

=over 4

=item * C<$loop> is the L<Linux::Event::Loop> instance

=item * C<$fh> is the watched filehandle

=item * C<$fd> is the integer file descriptor

=item * C<$mask> is an integer readiness mask (backend-defined bit layout,
standardized within this project)

=item * C<$tag> is an arbitrary user value (optional; may be undef)

=back

Backends may accept additional options in C<%opt>. This distribution uses:

=over 4

=item * C<_loop> - the loop reference to pass through to the callback

=item * C<tag> - the tag value to pass through to the callback

=back

=head2 unwatch($fh_or_fd) -> $bool

Remove a watcher by filehandle or file descriptor.

=head2 run_once($loop, $timeout_s=undef) -> $n

Block until events occur (or timeout) and dispatch them.

Return value is backend-defined; for now callers should not rely on it.

=head1 OPTIONAL METHODS

=head2 modify($fh_or_fd, $mask, %opt) -> $bool

Update an existing watcher registration (e.g. add/remove interest in writable).
If not implemented, the loop may fall back to unwatch+watch.
