=head1 NAME

Linux::Event::IO::Pipe - asynchronous ordered-byte I/O for pipes and FIFOs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package LinePipe;
  use parent 'Linux::Event::IO::Pipe';
  use Linux::Event::Framer 'Delimiter', "\n";

  sub on_message ($pipe, $line) {
      say "received: $line";
  }

  package main;
  pipe(my $read, my $write) or die "pipe: $!";

  my $pipe = $loop->add(LinePipe->new(
      read_fh => $read,
      data    => { messages => 0 },
  ));

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Linux::Event::IO::Pipe> is the public ordered-byte I/O class for anonymous
pipes and FIFOs. It uses the same native buffering, framing, output queue,
backpressure, deadlines, and directional lifecycle as the other ordered-byte
Linux::Event leaves without giving a pipe socket semantics.

A Pipe may be read-only, write-only, or duplex. Duplex operation may use two
different descriptors, which is useful for child stdin/stdout pairs and other
one-way pipe combinations.

=head1 CONSTRUCTION

C<new> accepts exactly one of these handle shapes:

  MyPipe->new(fh => $duplex_handle);
  MyPipe->new(read_fh => $input, write_fh => $output);
  MyPipe->new(read_fh => $input);
  MyPipe->new(write_fh => $output);

C<fh> means that one descriptor supplies both directions and cannot be combined
with C<read_fh> or C<write_fh>. Every supplied handle must be a Linux pipe or
FIFO. Linux::Event validates that identity before generic ordered-byte setup,
then makes owned descriptors nonblocking and close-on-exec.

C<loop =E<gt> $loop> attaches immediately. Otherwise construct detached and
pass the object to C<< $loop->add($pipe) >>. C<data> stores arbitrary
application state.

Ordered-byte deadline overrides C<idle_timeout>, C<read_timeout>, and
C<write_timeout>, plus an explicit C<deadline>, are also accepted. See
F<docs/ORDERED-BYTE-DEADLINES.md>.

=head1 INPUT CALLBACKS

A readable unframed subclass defines:

  sub on_data ($pipe, $bytes) { ... }

With L<Linux::Event::Framer>, a framed subclass normally defines:

  sub on_message ($pipe, $message) { ... }

or C<on_messages($pipe, $messages)> when C<message_batch_size> is enabled.
Optional lifecycle callbacks are C<on_eof>, C<on_drain>, C<on_error>, and
C<on_close>.

Each callback may instead be supplied as a coderef to C<new>. Constructor
callbacks override class methods for that Pipe and retain ordinary Perl lexical
scope. Input callbacks are cached in the same native ordered-byte state as
method callbacks rather than looked up for each read or message.

=head1 OUTPUT AND LIFECYCLE

C<write($bytes)> queues raw bytes. C<send($payload)> applies the subclass's
framer when one is declared. High/low watermarks provide cooperative
backpressure and C<max_pending_bytes> can impose a hard queue bound.

C<pause_read> and C<resume_read> control input delivery. C<end> drains accepted
output and ends the writable direction. C<close_read> and C<close_write> stop
one direction immediately; C<close> terminates the whole object.

C<detach> requires an empty output queue and transfers the still-open handles
back to the caller as a hash containing C<read_fh> and C<write_fh>. It is a
terminal ownership transfer and does not invoke C<on_close>.

=head1 CLASS POLICY

Subclasses may define C<stream_options> for the shared ordered-byte engine.
Important options include C<read_size>, C<read_budget_bytes>,
C<read_batch_bytes>, C<message_batch_size>, C<high_watermark>,
C<low_watermark>, C<max_pending_bytes>, C<max_buffer>, and established timeout
values. These are cached once per concrete subclass rather than parsed for each
instance.

Framing is valid for pipes because framing describes ordered application bytes,
not sockets. See L<Linux::Event::Framer> and F<docs/FRAMING.md>.
