=head1 NAME

Linux::Event::Loop - Linux-native epoll event loop

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Linux::Event::Loop;

  my $loop = Linux::Event::Loop->new;
  my $stream = $loop->add(MyStream->connect(
      host => '127.0.0.1', # required
      port => 9999,        # required
  ));
  $loop->run;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Linux::Event::Loop owns the native epoll instance, descriptor registry, event
buffer, and readiness dispatch. It is the only public loop class.

High-level objects may be attached in either of two equivalent ways:

  my $stream = MyStream->connect(
      loop => $loop,        # optional: attach immediately
      host => '127.0.0.1',  # required
      port => 9999,         # required
  );

  my $stream = MyStream->connect(
      host => '127.0.0.1', # required
      port => 9999,        # required
  );
  $loop->add($stream);

C<add> invokes the concrete object's attachment implementation and
returns the same object. Stream, Listener, Datagram, Timer, Signal, Wakeup, and
Process reject attachment to a second Loop or attachment after reaching a
terminal state.

C<watch> is the low-level descriptor API. It registers immediately and returns
an opaque native registration handle. The handle is not a public class or a
subclassing API.

=head1 HIGH-LEVEL OBJECTS

=head2 add($object)

Attaches a detached L<Linux::Event::Stream>, L<Linux::Event::Listener>,
L<Linux::Event::Datagram>, L<Linux::Event::Timer>,
L<Linux::Event::Signal>, L<Linux::Event::Wakeup>, or
L<Linux::Event::Process> and returns that exact object. The object becomes
owned by this Loop. Attaching it again, attaching it to another Loop, or
attaching a terminal object throws an exception.

The following are equivalent:

  my $a = MyStream->connect(
      loop => $loop,       # optional: attach immediately
      host => '127.0.0.1', # required
      port => 9999,        # required
  );
  my $b = $loop->add(MyStream->connect(
      host => '127.0.0.1', # required
      port => 9999,        # required
  ));

  my $timer = $loop->add(MyTimer->new(
      after => 0.25, # required one-shot delay
  ));

  my $socket = $loop->add(MyDatagram->new(
      host => '0.0.0.0', # required
      port => 9999,      # required
  ));

The C<loop> constructor option and C<add> are both primary public APIs.
Timer construction and scheduling deliberately use this generic attachment
path; Loop has no Timer-specific factory methods.

=head1 RAW DESCRIPTOR API

=head2 watch(fh => $fh, read => $callback) / watch(fd => $fd, read => $callback)

Registers exactly one filehandle or integer descriptor. Supported options are:

=over 4

=item * C<read>, C<write>, C<error>

Coderefs for readable, writable, and terminal/error readiness. Only C<read>
and C<write> control ordinary interest; terminal flags are always observed.
For one returned event, callback order is error, read, then write. Cancellation
after any callback suppresses the remaining callbacks for that event.

=item * C<data>

An arbitrary retained value available through C<< $registration->data >>.

=item * C<no_args =E<gt> 1>

Calls readiness coderefs without an argument. By default each receives the
opaque registration handle.

=item * C<lean =E<gt> 1>

With C<no_args>, avoids retaining references used only by handle accessors.
This is an expert registration-throughput optimization.

=item * C<edge_triggered =E<gt> 1>

Uses C<EPOLLET>. The callback must drain the descriptor until C<EAGAIN>.

=item * C<oneshot =E<gt> 1>

Uses C<EPOLLONESHOT>. The application is responsible for its rearm policy.

=back

Registering an fd that is already registered replaces its native registration
with C<EPOLL_CTL_MOD>. Cancelling the obsolete handle cannot remove the new
registration.

=head2 watch_fd($fd, read => $callback)

Low-level positional form used by Linux::Event internals and specialized code.
It creates the same native registration and has the same dispatch path as
C<watch>. Normal application code should prefer C<watch>.

=head2 unwatch_fd($fd)

Cancels the current registration for C<$fd>, if any. Prefer the registration's
C<cancel> method when the handle is available.

=head1 REGISTRATION METHODS

The opaque result of C<watch> supports C<fd>, C<fh>, C<data>, C<loop>, C<lean>,
C<cancel>, C<enable_read>, C<disable_read>, C<enable_write>, and
C<disable_write>. C<cancel> is idempotent and makes an obsolete handle inert,
including after native watcher storage is reused. Cancellation releases the
registration's retained Perl state. An fd-only registration returns undef from
C<fh>.

=head1 DRIVING THE LOOP

=head2 run

Waits and dispatches until C<stop> is called.

=head2 run_once($timeout_ms = -1)

Runs one C<epoll_wait>. A negative timeout blocks indefinitely, zero polls, and
a positive value is a maximum wait in milliseconds. Returns the number of
events returned by epoll. A prior C<stop> request does not suppress a later
C<run_once> call.

=head2 run_for($seconds)

Runs against a monotonic deadline for the supplied non-negative number of
seconds.

Only one driver method may be active for a given Loop. Calling C<run>,
C<run_once>, or C<run_for> recursively on that same Loop throws an exception;
a callback may drive a different Loop. C<set_event_capacity> is likewise
rejected while its Loop is running or dispatching.

=head2 stop

Requests that the active C<run> or C<run_for> return after the current dispatch
work completes.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS AND TUNING

C<stats> returns counters for epoll waits, event classes, callbacks,
registrations, Timer scheduling and delivery, dispatch batching, and lifecycle
activity. C<reset_stats>
resets them. C<enable_profile(1)> additionally records nanosecond timing and
changes the measured workload, so it should be disabled for normal benchmarks.

C<event_capacity> and C<set_event_capacity> inspect or change the reusable
event array. C<callback_scope_limit> and C<set_callback_scope_limit> control
bounded Perl temporary scopes. C<enable_watcher_reclaim> exposes an
experimental native memory/throughput tradeoff. The measured defaults should
normally remain unchanged.

=head1 INTERPRETER OWNERSHIP

A Loop and every native object it owns belong to the Perl interpreter that
created them. They are not cloned into a new ithread. Only a cloned
L<Linux::Event::Wakeup> handle may signal its owner through eventfd; it cannot
manage the Loop, invoke callbacks, or access owner-interpreter data.

=head1 PLATFORM

Linux only. The implementation uses epoll directly.
