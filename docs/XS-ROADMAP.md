# XS Roadmap

The generic reactor and the first native Stream engine are now implemented in
the same Linux::Event distribution. The guiding rule remains:

> Perl should receive semantic events; XS should absorb repetitive mechanical
> events whenever doing so preserves a clean, general API.

## Completed foundation

- XS-first epoll loop and native watcher registry
- direct native watcher dispatch
- native Stream readable draining
- reusable native framed-input storage
- native immediate writes and segmented `writev()` queue draining
- native backpressure byte accounting
- optional hard native pending-output limits with typed terminal errors
- native transport operation contract with a specialized plain-fd fast path
- native Delimiter framing
- native Fixed framing
- native configurable LengthPrefix framing
- native U32BE framing
- native Netstring framing
- native Varint framing
- native DecimalLength framing
- one immutable callback/framer/transport descriptor per Stream subclass
- lightweight per-connection references to shared descriptors
- exact-name declarative loading without a duplicate framer keyword registry
- raw `on_data` fallback for application-specific protocols
- in-place raw/framed protocol transitions that retain unread native input,
  queued output, registration identity, lifecycle, and application state
- one shared timerfd plus an indexed native deadline heap per Loop
- cached subclass callbacks, fixed-rate recurrence, coalescing, and bounded
  dispatch for public Timer objects
- one shared signalfd, native fan-out registry, aggregate delivery, and exact
  mask restoration for public Signal objects

These are permanent regression targets. New work must not trade them away
without benchmark evidence.

## Completed - unified object lifecycle

`Linux::Event::Loop` owns high-level Stream, Listener, Datagram, Timer, Signal,
Wakeup, and Process objects through `add()`, while `watch()` creates an
immediately attached opaque native registration. There is no public Watcher or
IO base class. One logical object may own several internal epoll registrations.

Timer uses that same attachment contract without adding Loop-specific factory
methods. The abstract public Timer class caches `on_timer` once per subclass;
active instances live entirely in the Loop's native scheduler.

Signal uses the same attachment contract. Its abstract public class caches
`on_signal` once per subclass, while each Loop's private native service owns
the signalfd mask and supports multiple numbers per object plus multiple
objects per number.

`MyStream->connect()` keeps one Stream identity through outbound acquisition
and optional TLS readiness. `Linux::Event::Listener` with a configured
`stream_class`
owns inbound acquisition and constructs accepted Streams. The public hierarchy
adds no generic Perl call to steady-state native readiness dispatch.

## Completed - initial TLS provider implementation

HTTPS, secure WebSocket, and Discord require TLS. TLS is a byte transport
transform, not a message framer. The internal native operation boundary and
plain provider now exist. The bundled `Linux::Event::TLS` provider attaches
without adding OpenSSL policy or calls to the reactor core or the plain Stream
path.

The design must cover handshake readiness, encrypted and plaintext buffering,
certificate/hostname errors, shutdown, deadlines, ALPN, and transitions such as
STARTTLS without putting TLS policy into the reactor core. Initial client/server TLS,
verification, ALPN, cross-direction readiness, and close notification landed
with the 0.100_015 transport ABI. Version 0.100_016 added provider-owned
deadline-watcher lifecycle and the original external Linux::Event::TLS 0.002
added default handshake and shutdown deadlines, clean/unclean EOF
classification, native counters, and a same-Stream plain-versus-TLS benchmark.
Version 0.100_017 merged that provider into the main distribution without
merging its OpenSSL implementation into the native Stream engine.

The released attachment exact-versions the common ABI, retains provider
lifetime, and implements cross-direction readiness (`SSL_read` wanting write
and `SSL_write` wanting read). Established Stream deadlines now cover TLS after
provider readiness. Richer shutdown diagnostics, provider bounded-buffer
observability and live transport replacement remain follow-up work.

## Completed - Stream connection layer

`MyStream->connect()` owns the public outbound lifecycle. Its private
`Linux::Event::Stream::_Connection` engine implements strict
IPv4/IPv6/Unix/packed address modes, typed errors, silent cancellation, and a
default connection deadline. Socket creation uses
`SOCK_NONBLOCK | SOCK_CLOEXEC` atomically. Immediate results are deferred so
network callbacks never run inside the constructor.

The policy/state machine remains in cold Perl code. A small native timerfd
helper supplies monotonic deadlines and deferred dispatch. Same-fd native
replacement uses one `EPOLL_CTL_MOD` where an fd registration is replaced.

## Completed - native Listener layer

`Linux::Event::Listener` creates or adopts listening stream sockets and
constructs a configured Stream subclass for each accepted connection. A small
private native extension drains `accept4()` with atomic nonblocking and
close-on-exec flags and retains packed peer addresses for lazy conversion.

The default level-triggered fairness cap is safe because epoll reports a
remaining backlog again. Edge-triggered listeners require an unlimited drain.
No temporary accepted-socket registration is created before Stream attachment.
Resource exhaustion pauses readiness before typed error delivery.

## Completed - asynchronous Resolver and Happy Eyeballs

Hostname resolution is mechanically separate from Stream and Datagram socket
policy in the private `Linux::Event::_Resolver` XS extension. Each Loop lazily
owns two native resolver workers and one eventfd completion queue. Workers
never enter Perl. The normal raw Loop watch path drains complete candidate
collections, cancelled requests discard late results, IPv6/IPv4 attempts are
staggered by 250 ms, and first-success
ownership closes all losers. Literal, Unix, and packed addresses bypass the
resolver. Dedicated integration, cancellation, ordering, and microbenchmark
coverage protects the boundary.

## Completed - signalfd signal handling

`Linux::Event::Signal` provides synchronous Loop-thread delivery without Perl
signal handlers. One lazy signalfd and native subscription registry per Loop
drain and aggregate records before fan-out. Cancellation is safe during
callbacks, last-subscriber removal restores only mask entries Linux::Event
changed, and one signal number has one owning Loop per process. Resolver
workers block signals independently so native DNS cannot intercept them.

## Completed - established Stream deadlines

Stream subclasses cache idle, read, and write inactivity defaults, while each
instance may override them and own one explicit overall-operation deadline.
Established policy begins only after plain or TLS readiness and reports typed
timeout errors through the ordinary Stream close lifecycle.

At most one private Timer per Stream represents the earliest condition in the
Loop's existing timerfd/native heap. XS records successful transport activity
only when inactivity policy is enabled. Ordinary Streams perform no timestamp
syscalls, and enabled I/O progress does not enter Perl merely to move a heap
entry. Plain, TLS, transition, pause/resume, EOF, queued-write, and regression
benchmark coverage protect the contract.

## Completed - eventfd Wakeup boundary

`Linux::Event::Wakeup` exposes one subclass-defined eventfd notification
object. Foreign native threads, fork children, and cloned ithread handles may
increment its counter without entering the Loop interpreter. The Loop drains
one counter value per turn and delivers one semantic `on_wakeup` callback.

Wakeup deliberately carries no Perl payload and is not a coderef posting
queue. Applications publish data through their own thread-safe queue or IPC
channel before signalling. Thread clones own duplicate descriptors, while
callback state, Loop ownership, and application data remain confined to the
creating interpreter.

## Completed - production socket configuration

Stream class policy and constructor overrides cover local address binding,
`TCP_NODELAY`, keepalive tuning, `TCP_USER_TIMEOUT`, buffer sizing, and Linux
interface binding. Built-in policy is applied to every outbound candidate and
to accepted or adopted sockets before transport attachment. A cached
`configure_socket` hook follows built-in policy for advanced cold-path setup.

Public timeout values use seconds. Options with meaningful Linux live behavior
also have getters/setters that return the effective kernel value. Failures are
structured `socket_configuration` Errors; incompatible address families never
fall through to an unconfigured candidate.

## Completed - packet-preserving Datagram layer

`Linux::Event::Datagram` provides connected and unconnected UDP plus filesystem
Unix datagrams. Native `recvmsg(MSG_TRUNC)` batching retains packet boundaries,
original packet sizes, and packed peers. Native `send`/`sendto` preserves whole
packets through bounded output queues, soft backpressure, and hard byte or
packet limits. Connected hostname mode uses the private asynchronous resolver
with datagram hints.

Ownership, detach, Unix-path cleanup, source-specific option validation,
truncation reporting, and Loop-thread callback ordering are part of the public
contract.

## Completed - pidfd Process layer

`Linux::Event::Process` uses `posix_spawnp`, pidfd readiness,
`waitid(P_PIDFD)`, and `pidfd_send_signal`. One object owns lifecycle, decoded
exit status, and optional asynchronous stdin/stdout/stderr pipes. Output is
drained before `on_exit`; stdin writes suppress SIGPIPE without changing
process-wide signal policy.

Detached spawn specifications are side-effect free until Loop attachment. No
Perl code runs in a post-fork child, caller filehandles stay caller-owned, and
partial setup failure kills and reaps a newly spawned child before releasing
resources.

The essential completion surface is complete in version 0.101. The remaining
items below are optional expansion and evidence-driven optimization, not
release blockers.

## Permanent boundary - asynchronous abstractions

Future, Promise, and async/await runtimes are not part of the Linux::Event core
roadmap. They belong in independent distributions built on the public reactor
and object APIs. Core must not acquire Future-specific return values,
continuation scheduling, callback setters, hidden microtask policy, or an
arbitrary coderef posting queue.

Linux::Event must nevertheless remain sufficient for a third-party adapter to
provide those abstractions. The supported primitive surface includes:

- persistent and single-iteration Loop driving;
- non-inline next-turn delivery through a zero-delay Timer;
- explicit object cancellation, deadlines, and structured errors;
- semantic Stream, Listener, Datagram, Process, Timer, and Signal callbacks;
- output-drain and terminal lifecycle notifications; and
- Wakeup notification for work published through an application-owned safe
  cross-thread or cross-process channel.

The cached subclass-callback model is intentional. An adapter may provide its
own concrete subclasses and keep pending operations in application state; core
will not add per-instance callback mutation merely to imitate another runtime.

A new general-purpose primitive should be considered only when an external
proof of concept demonstrates that an asynchronous abstraction cannot be
implemented safely with the existing API. Any such addition must solve a
reactor-level ownership, cancellation, ordering, or wakeup problem independent
of Futures and async/await.

## Priority 1 - General native framing families

Expand the built-in framing catalog while keeping one rule: built-in boundary
detection is native, while application-specific protocols parse raw `on_data`
bytes. Do not reintroduce a second arbitrary framer-object contract.

Near-term framing families include:

- a configurable `HeaderLength` family with header size, field offset/width,
  byte order, length adjustment, header inclusion, and frame limit
- additional standardized variable-integer length prefixes
- escaped/stuffed serial framing such as SLIP and COBS
- other general wire-framing families that can be expressed without embedding
  application protocol semantics

Keep protocol-specific state machines separate when the work is more than
message-boundary detection. A new general family needs a declarative module,
corresponding XS parser mode, wire-contract tests, and a native-framer benchmark
row. Its exact package name becomes the declaration name automatically.

## Priority 2 - Stream watcher-state transitions (measured)

The watcher-state boundary has now been profiled before any ownership change.
`bench/run-stream-watcher-state-bench.pl` separates kernel `epoll_ctl` cost from
Stream coordination and covers lifecycle, forced-EAGAIN, close, half-close,
handshake, and TLS shutdown transitions.

The first profile found that ordinary Streams rebuilt an empty deadline
candidate set on pause, resume, write-queue drain, and EOF. Guarding that work
by the relevant read or write timeout reduced median pause/resume CPU from
3.559 to 1.533 microseconds per cycle and forced-EAGAIN queue/drain CPU from
18.854 to 18.122 microseconds per cycle on the measurement host. The public API
and deadline behavior did not change.

Do not add the proposed cross-extension watcher ABI now. The two required
`EPOLL_CTL_MOD` calls consume about 0.48 microseconds of an 18.12-microsecond
forced-EAGAIN cycle and cannot be removed while retaining level-triggered
correctness. Initial registration's one `MOD` is below one percent of Stream
attachment CPU, while plain close and half-close expose no repeated interest
transition. Loop remains the sole epoll owner and Stream retains an opaque
registration. Reopen this item only if a representative application profile
shows the remaining boundary is material.

## Priority 3 - Callback coalescing/batching

This item has now been implemented and measured without changing the ordinary
callback contract. Both class options default to zero and the zero modes do not
allocate batch containers:

- raw `read_batch_bytes` combines successful reads up to a native byte bound
  and still flushes at EAGAIN, EOF, or error;
- framed `message_batch_size` explicitly replaces `on_message` with
  `on_messages($stream, $messages)` and flushes without waiting for later input;
- pause, close, and transition act at the selected batch boundary.

The August 28, 2026 pipelined 64-byte sweep used 1,000,000 messages, 4 KiB
native reads, one warmup, and five measured repeats. The focused 16/32/64
comparison produced these medians on the measurement host:

| Transport | Ordinary | Batch 16 | Batch 32 | Batch 64 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| AF_UNIX | 129.7 MiB/s | 263.4 MiB/s | 276.2 MiB/s | 305.6 MiB/s |
| TCP loopback | 126.8 MiB/s | 227.0 MiB/s | 282.1 MiB/s | 311.3 MiB/s |

Batch 32 removed 96.9 percent of message-callback entries and provided the most
balanced cross-transport throughput/latency point. Batch 64 is available for
throughput-oriented protocols; protocols with message-by-message transition
semantics retain ordinary delivery. Batch size one is intentionally valid as a
contract/control case but was slower than `on_message` because it constructs an
array without amortizing a callback.

With Stream's normal 64 KiB read size, a 64 KiB raw batch provided no material
benefit. A 256 KiB raw aggregate reduced median TCP callback count by 74.1
percent and improved median payload throughput by 18.4 percent; a 1 MiB bound
improved it by 24.1 percent but increases retained memory and pause granularity.
Raw coalescing therefore remains explicit and has no nonzero recommended
default.

The saturated-producer fairness diagnostic found no new batching regression:
batching generally reached EAGAIN sooner and reduced probe latency. It also
made an older policy visible: an indefinitely readable Stream can retain one
readiness turn until EAGAIN and delay unrelated descriptors. Any future read
budget must be evaluated as a separate fairness change rather than hidden in
the batching API.

## Priority 4 - Native connect attempt completion

Profile before moving the remaining attempt state machine below Perl. If
high-churn connection workloads justify it, native code may:

- handle EINPROGRESS
- wait for writable readiness
- check `SO_ERROR`
- coordinate concurrent attempt readiness
- cancel timeout state
- notify Perl once with success or failure

The public Stream connection contract must not change merely to eliminate a
few cold Perl calls.

The 2026-08-29 experiment moved the readiness-time `SO_ERROR` probe into native
Loop dispatch while leaving candidate policy and Stream handoff unchanged. A
balanced 600,000-connection loopback TCP comparison at concurrency 10 measured
aggregate medians of 10,614.7 connections/second for the Perl probe and
10,741.6 for the native probe. That apparent 1.2% advantage did not survive
paired analysis: the repeat-pair median was -0.5%, with run variance much
larger than the difference. The special watcher path was therefore removed.

Do not revisit native completion merely to relocate `getsockopt(SO_ERROR)`.
A future experiment needs a workload dominated by multiple simultaneous
Happy Eyeballs attempts, failed candidates, or deadline cancellation, and must
move that coordination as one unit. Ordinary successful single-candidate
connection completion remains in Perl.

## Priority 5 - Additional Linux fd drain helpers

Profile native draining or aggregation for additional descriptor families only
when Perl currently receives repetitive mechanical events.

## Priority 6 - Buffer representation experiments

Only if profiling justifies them:

- sliding-buffer refinements
- ring-buffer alternatives
- allocation reuse or slabs

Do not optimize allocation speculatively.

## Priority 7 - Protocol acceleration above Stream

After the generic framing catalog is broad, consider reusable protocol engines
such as HTTP or WebSocket parsing. Application semantics remain Perl even when
mechanical parsing moves native.

## Benchmark policy

Keep the reactor comparison as the low-level regression standard. Keep Stream
transport/output-limit, framing, protocol-transition, and
lifecycle/retained-memory benchmarks separate.
Cross-runtime Stream
benchmarks compare high-level facilities and must continue to report exact
fairness contracts, server CPU per message, throughput, latency, and memory.
