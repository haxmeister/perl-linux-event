# Ordered byte I/O design

Linux::Event shares one high-performance ordered-byte engine across several
concrete public resources:

```text
Linux::Event::IO::Pipe
Linux::Event::IO::TTY
Linux::Event::IO::Sock::Stream
```

There is deliberately no public generic ByteStream or Stream class in this
semantic model. The common engine is private implementation machinery because
applications should choose the leaf that describes the actual Linux resource.

## Why these resources share machinery

Pipes, terminals, and `SOCK_STREAM` sockets all present an ordered sequence of
bytes to the application. They differ in acquisition and kernel lifecycle
semantics, but the expensive steady-state mechanics are the same:

- nonblocking reads;
- immediate and queued writes;
- partial-write handling;
- backpressure;
- input buffering;
- framing;
- callback batching;
- parser state;
- established deadlines;
- protocol transitions.

Sharing that native machinery preserves performance without forcing the public
API to pretend that a pipe is a socket or that every form of I/O is a stream.

## Handle shapes

The private ordered-byte engine supports these directional forms:

```perl
MyType->new(fh => $duplex_handle);
MyType->new(read_fh => $input, write_fh => $output);
MyType->new(read_fh => $input);
MyType->new(write_fh => $output);
```

A concrete public leaf decides which forms make semantic sense and validates
its handles.

`IO::Pipe` can represent one pipe direction or a logical pair of pipe handles.
`IO::TTY` can use terminal input, terminal output, or both. A connected
`IO::Sock::Stream` uses one shared socket descriptor.

`fh` means one descriptor supplies both directions and cannot be combined with
`read_fh` or `write_fh`. For split objects, `fh()` is undefined while
`read_fh`, `write_fh`, `read_fd`, and `write_fd` remain unambiguous.

Every unique descriptor is made nonblocking and close-on-exec. One shared
descriptor uses one Loop registration. Split read/write descriptors use two
registrations that point at the same native ordered-byte state.

## Native state

The native state contains independent read and write descriptor numbers, which
may be equal or absent for one direction. It still owns exactly one copy of the
expensive mutable mechanisms:

- immutable cached class descriptor reference;
- reusable raw read buffer or framed input storage;
- native parser state;
- optional native consumer context;
- segmented output queue;
- backpressure watermarks;
- optional activity timestamps;
- instrumentation counters.

The ordinary plain path calls `read`, `write`, and `writev` directly. No
reader/writer object pair, constructor closure, duplicate output queue, or
extra Perl dispatch layer is introduced.

## Cached class policy

Each concrete subclass receives one immutable descriptor containing:

- resolved named callback CVs;
- `stream_options()` values;
- optional framer definition;
- optional native consumer definition;
- native descriptor configuration.

Per-object state retains only changing fd, parser, queue, deadline, transport,
and lifecycle data.

This is a performance-critical design choice. Callback lookup and tuning-policy
assembly occur at the class descriptor boundary, not for every readiness event
or every connection instance.

The historical method name `stream_options()` remains the current tuning hook
while the implementation migration is completed. It describes ordered-byte
engine policy, not a public `Linux::Event::Stream` object.

## Read sink rules

A write-only object does not need an input callback.

A readable raw ordered-byte subclass defines:

```perl
sub on_data ($self, $bytes) {
    ...
}
```

A readable framed subclass normally defines:

```perl
sub on_message ($self, $message) {
    ...
}
```

or, with explicit `message_batch_size`, `on_messages`. A framed class can also
bind a supported native consumer.

These rules are validated when the class descriptor is first built.

## Directional lifecycle

Read and write termination are independent normal states.

- Peer/input EOF ends the readable direction and invokes `on_eof`.
- EOF does not end an independent writable direction.
- `end($final_bytes)` accepts optional final output, drains queued bytes, then
  ends the writable direction gracefully.
- `close_read` and `close_write` stop one direction immediately.
- `close` stops the complete object and may discard queued output.
- `on_close` runs once when the complete configured resource becomes terminal.
- `pause_read` and `resume_read` affect only input.

For distinct pipe or terminal handles, ending a direction can close that
specific descriptor.

A generic shared non-socket descriptor has no universal half-close syscall.
The ordered-byte engine therefore records logical write completion without
inventing kernel semantics that may not exist.

`IO::Sock::Stream` adds the socket-specific mapping to `shutdown()` where
appropriate.

## Detach

Plain ordered-byte resources can transfer descriptor ownership only when the
resource-specific contract permits it and pending output has drained.

The private engine can represent the returned directional handles as:

```perl
{
    read_fh  => $read_handle_or_undef,
    write_fh => $write_handle_or_undef,
}
```

A stream socket has one shared descriptor and its public socket layer can expose
the appropriate socket-shaped detach result.

Non-plain transports such as TLS cannot detach a bare descriptor while native
provider state is still coupled to it.

## Writes and backpressure

`write()` first attempts a native write immediately. EPOLLOUT interest is
enabled only after partial output or EAGAIN and disabled again when the queue
empties.

`high_watermark` and `low_watermark` implement cooperative backpressure.
`max_pending_bytes` is an optional hard limit.

The same queue and watermark behavior applies during outbound stream-socket
connection acquisition so applications do not need a second preconnection
output API.

## Framing

Framing is a property of ordered bytes, not of sockets. The same native framing
families can therefore be declared by pipe, terminal, and stream-socket
subclasses.

`send()` applies the declared outbound framing rule and then enters the same
native write engine.

Serialization remains above framing:

```text
bytes -> framing -> message bytes -> codec -> Perl value
```

See `FRAMING.md` for wire contracts and parser behavior.

## Raw and framed batching

A raw class can set `read_batch_bytes` to combine successful reads before
`on_data`. A framed class can set `message_batch_size` to deliver a bounded
array through `on_messages`.

Partial batches flush when the current native drain ends. Linux::Event does not
wait for future readiness merely to fill the configured batch size.

The zero defaults preserve ordinary callback boundaries without array creation.

## Deadlines

Idle, read, write, and explicit operation deadlines are ordered-byte policy and
therefore can apply to any appropriate public leaf using this engine.

Deadline candidates exist only for configured and active directions. Activity
timestamps are enabled only when inactivity policy is active, so ordinary
objects do not pay clock-reading overhead.

Connection acquisition deadlines and TLS handshake/shutdown deadlines belong
to the stream-socket acquisition/transport layers rather than this established
ordered-byte layer.

## Protocol transitions

`transition_to()` changes the cached protocol descriptor while retaining the
same native ordered-byte state, descriptors, buffered input, output queue,
backpressure state, deadlines, and application data.

The target must represent the same underlying resource category. Protocol
transition must not silently turn a pipe into a socket or a connected socket
into a TTY.

Unread native input is interpreted by the target framing policy after the
transition. Existing queued output is not reframed.

## Socket specialization

`IO::Sock::Stream` adds semantics that do not belong to generic ordered bytes:

- connected `SOCK_STREAM` validation;
- outbound connection acquisition;
- socket addresses;
- socket option policy;
- `configure_socket` hook;
- kernel `shutdown()` behavior;
- TLS transport declaration and negotiated-state accessors.

TCP, Unix-domain stream sockets, and socketpairs share this leaf because they
share `SOCK_STREAM` semantics. Address family remains configuration.

## Private implementation migration

The current release work is moving the public API away from the historical
`Linux::Event::Stream` and `Linux::Event::Socket` names. Proven XS package names
and portions of the Perl implementation still use those historical names
internally while they are moved behind:

```text
Linux::Event::_ByteStream
Linux::Event::_ByteStream::Descriptor
Linux::Event::_Socket::Stream
Linux::Event::_Socket::Descriptor
```

Those historical/internal names are `no_index` and are not the public
subclassing contract.

This migration deliberately leaves the native hot path intact. Renaming native
symbols is not a reason to add ABI churn, dynamic loading boundaries, or Perl
indirection.

## Native consumer ABI

The framed-message native consumer ABI belongs to the private ordered-byte
engine and remains independent of Linux::Event::Async. Stream-socket subclasses
use the same consumer mechanism; there is no socket-specific duplicate path.

Existing ABI versioning, borrowed message ownership, pause/resume semantics,
and terminal-event contracts remain unchanged during the public namespace
refactor.

## Performance invariant

The architectural rename must not reduce the performance properties that drove
the existing implementation:

- one native mutable state per logical ordered-byte object;
- one cached immutable descriptor per concrete class;
- direct cached CV callback invocation;
- direct plain `read`/`write`/`writev` syscalls;
- no per-message framer objects;
- no constructor callback closures required;
- no generic public dispatch layer;
- one watcher for the common single-fd stream-socket path.

Any later physical source or XS package rename should be benchmarked as a
refactor, not assumed to be free merely because the public semantics are
unchanged.
