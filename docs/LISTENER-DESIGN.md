# Stream socket listener design

`Linux::Event::IO::Sock::Listener` owns a listening Linux `SOCK_STREAM`
socket and constructs one configured `Linux::Event::IO::Sock::Stream`
subclass for every accepted connection.

The listener remains a distinct public leaf because its API is accept-oriented.
A listening `SOCK_STREAM` socket is not exposed as though it were an established
ordered-byte connection.

## Public API

```perl
my $server_state = { connections => {} };

my $listener = Linux::Event::IO::Sock::Listener->new(
    loop                => $loop,
    stream_class        => 'ServerConnection',
    host                => '0.0.0.0',
    port                => 9999,
    backlog             => 4096,
    max_accept_per_tick => 256,
    edge_triggered      => 0,
    data                => $server_state,
);
```

Detached construction is equivalent:

```perl
my $listener = Linux::Event::IO::Sock::Listener->new(
    stream_class => 'ServerConnection',
    unix         => '/run/app.sock',
    unlink       => 1,
    permissions  => 0660,
);
$loop->add($listener);
```

`stream_class` names the completed stream-socket subclass constructed for each
accepted descriptor. The listener's `data` value is passed to each accepted
object initially; `on_accept` can replace that connection's data if desired.

## Socket type and address family

The listener always represents `SOCK_STREAM` in listening state. Its address
family is selected independently.

Exactly one source form is required:

- `host => $host, port => $port` creates an IPv4/IPv6 listener;
- `unix => $path` creates a filesystem Unix-domain stream listener;
- `fh => $listening_socket` adopts an existing listening `SOCK_STREAM` handle.

A Unix listener is therefore not a separate public `Socket::Unix` class. Both
Internet and Unix-domain listeners use `IO::Sock::Listener` because socket type
and role are the same.

Created listener sockets are nonblocking and close-on-exec and are owned by the
listener. An adopted handle defaults to caller ownership; `owns_socket => 1`
transfers ownership.

`host => '*'` selects passive wildcard resolution. When `port => 0` is used,
`port()` reports the kernel-assigned port after construction.

## Source-specific configuration

Internet listener options include:

- `backlog`
- `reuseaddr`
- `reuseport`
- `v6only`
- `bind_device`

Unix-domain options include:

- `backlog`
- `unlink`
- `unlink_on_close`
- `permissions`

Options that have no meaning for the selected source are rejected rather than
silently ignored.

Examples:

```perl
my $tcp = Linux::Event::IO::Sock::Listener->new(
    stream_class => 'ServerConnection',
    host         => '::',
    port         => 9999,
    reuseaddr    => 1,
    reuseport    => 0,
    v6only       => 1,
    bind_device  => 'eth0',
);
```

```perl
my $unix = Linux::Event::IO::Sock::Listener->new(
    stream_class    => 'ServerConnection',
    unix            => '/run/app.sock',
    unlink          => 0,
    unlink_on_close => 1,
    permissions     => 0660,
);
```

```perl
my $adopted = Linux::Event::IO::Sock::Listener->new(
    stream_class => 'ServerConnection',
    fh           => $socket,
    owns_socket  => 0,
);
```

## Accept behavior

Native code drains `accept4()` with atomic
`SOCK_NONBLOCK | SOCK_CLOEXEC` flags.

`max_accept_per_tick` defaults to 256 to bound one level-triggered readiness
turn. Zero means drain until EAGAIN and is required with
`edge_triggered => 1`.

Each accepted descriptor is used immediately to construct the configured
`IO::Sock::Stream` subclass and attach that object to the same Loop. Linux::Event
does not create a temporary accepted-descriptor registration first.

## on_accept

A listener subclass can observe each fully constructed connection:

```perl
package ServerListener;
use parent 'Linux::Event::IO::Sock::Listener';

sub on_accept ($listener, $connection) {
    $listener->data->{connections}{ $connection->fd } = $connection;
}
```

The sequence is:

```text
accept4
  -> construct stream_class
  -> attach connection to Loop
  -> listener on_accept
  -> connection readiness
```

For a plain stream socket, `on_ready` follows after `on_accept`. For TLS,
`on_accept` still runs after attachment, while the connection's `on_ready` waits
until handshake and verification succeed.

`on_accept` may inspect, retain, configure application state on, or close the
connection.

Peer addresses are represented by `Linux::Event::Address` and formatted lazily.
Applications that never inspect `peer()` avoid textual address conversion.

## Accepted connection policy

Buffering, framing, backpressure, and established deadline policy belong to the
`stream_class` through `stream_options()`. Socket-specific established policy
belongs to that same class through `socket_options()`.

Example TLS server connection:

```perl
package SecureServerConnection;
use parent 'Linux::Event::IO::Sock::Stream';
use Linux::Event::TLS
    cert_file => '/etc/myapp/server-cert.pem',
    key_file  => '/etc/myapp/server-key.pem',
    alpn      => ['my-protocol/1'];

sub stream_options ($class) {
    return (
        idle_timeout => 60,
        max_buffer   => 8 * 1024 * 1024,
    );
}

sub socket_options ($class) {
    return tcp_nodelay => 1;
}
```

The listener then names the completed class:

```perl
my $listener = Linux::Event::IO::Sock::Listener->new(
    loop         => $loop,
    stream_class => 'SecureServerConnection',
    host         => '0.0.0.0',
    port         => 9443,
    data         => $server_state,
);
```

A server TLS declaration is validated before the listener begins accepting
traffic. Each accepted connection receives fresh server-side OpenSSL state.
There is no per-accept constructor callback layer.

Built-in accepted socket policy and the optional cached
`configure_socket($class, $fh, 'accepted', $peer)` hook run before application
readiness or TLS startup.

## Listener lifecycle

`pause()` and `resume()` control accepting without closing the listening
socket. `close()` ends listener ownership. `detach()` removes Loop readiness and
returns the still-open listener handle according to the ownership contract.

`state()` reports the listener lifecycle state, including unattached,
listening, paused, closed/failed, and detached states as defined by the
implementation.

## Errors

Runtime failures use `Linux::Event::Error`. Resource exhaustion such as
`EMFILE` pauses acceptance before reporting the error so a readable backlog
cannot create a tight error loop.

A listener subclass can handle runtime failure explicitly:

```perl
package AppListener;
use parent 'Linux::Event::IO::Sock::Listener';

sub on_error ($listener, $error) {
    warn "$error\n";
}
```

An exception from `on_accept` closes that accepted connection, suppresses its
pending readiness callback, and reports a nonfatal callback error to the
listener's error policy. The listening socket can remain active when the error
is handled.

## Address introspection

`family()` reports semantic family names such as `inet`, `inet6`, or `unix`.
`family_number()` exposes the native numeric address family. Convenience
predicates can distinguish Internet versus Unix-domain sources without
pretending address family is the socket type.

## Private implementation host

The historical `Linux::Event::Listener` package and its XS accept engine remain
the stable private implementation host beneath
`Linux::Event::_Socket::Listener`. The supported public contract is
`Linux::Event::IO::Sock::Listener`.

The historical package is `no_index` and excluded from META `provides`.
Retaining the proven native accept engine there avoids source churn or an extra
dispatch boundary solely for naming. It is an implementation detail, not an
alternate public listener API or an unfinished relocation.
