# Stream design

`Linux::Event::Stream` is an owned buffered byte-stream object above the
`Linux::Event::Loop` reactor. It is intentionally Linux-only and uses native
code for repetitive I/O, queue, buffer, and built-in framing work.

## Type model

`Linux::Event::Stream` is a base class. An application defines each stream type
as an ordinary Perl package:

```perl
package ChatStream;
use parent 'Linux::Event::Stream';
use Linux::Event::Framer 'Delimiter', "\n";

sub on_message ($stream, $message) { ... }
sub on_drain   ($stream)           { ... }
sub on_eof     ($stream)           { ... }
sub on_error   ($stream, $error)   { ... }
sub on_close   ($stream)           { ... }
```

A package does not imply one global connection. It defines shared behavior.
Each object remains a distinct connection and carries its application value in
`data`:

```perl
my $stream = $loop->add(ChatStream->new(
    fh   => $socket,
    data => {
        user_id    => $user_id,
        permissions => $permissions,
        rooms       => {},
    },
));
```

The established constructor also accepts `loop => $loop`. Outbound
`ChatStream->connect(...)` and inbound `ChatStream->listen(...)` follow the same
rule: pass `loop` for immediate attachment or omit it and use `Loop->add()`.
Both forms attach the same object without a wrapper or public base class.

`connect()` keeps one Stream identity across `unattached`, `connecting`,
`active`, and `closed` states. `listen()` returns a Listener configured to
construct this Stream subclass. See `STREAM-CONNECTIONS.md`,
`LISTENER-DESIGN.md`, and `OBJECT-LIFECYCLE.md`.

## Class descriptor

The first construction of each concrete subclass performs all class-level work
once:

1. resolve `on_data`, `on_message`, and optional lifecycle methods through the
   class MRO;
2. resolve the nearest inherited native framer declaration;
3. call and validate `stream_options`;
4. validate that the class is either raw or framed, never both;
5. create one immutable XS descriptor holding parser config, transport policy,
   and callback references.

Subsequent construction retrieves that descriptor from the class cache. The
Perl object and native connection state each retain a reference to it.

Immutable descriptor state includes:

- named callback CVs
- native read mode and framing constants
- delimiter or prefix policy where applicable
- `read_size`
- high and low output watermarks
- optional hard `max_pending_bytes`
- framed `max_buffer`

Per-connection native state includes:

- fd and Stream reference
- active native transport operations and provider context
- pause, EOF, close, and backpressure flags
- native input bytes and parser scan state
- segmented output queue and pending byte count
- instrumentation counters

Per-connection Perl state includes the loop, handle, native registration, optional `data`,
and semantic lifecycle flags. It does not contain callback option hashes or a
framer object.

## Input paths

All mechanical byte movement enters through the native transport boundary.
The current `plain` provider specializes directly to fd syscalls; the parser
and queue do not depend on that provider identity.

### Raw subclass

```text
EPOLLIN -> XS read drain -> on_data($stream, $bytes)
```

The reusable native read buffer is copied into a Perl byte scalar only after a
successful read. XS continues until EAGAIN unless the callback pauses or closes
the Stream.

### Framed subclass

```text
EPOLLIN -> XS read drain -> native input storage -> native parser
        -> on_message($stream, $message)
```

Complete built-in frames are detected without delivering intermediate read
chunks to Perl. Multiple messages can be emitted from one readiness event.
Partial prefixes, delimiters, and payloads remain in connection-local native
state. The loop rechecks pause and close state after every callback.

## Output path

`write($bytes)` first attempts an immediate native write. Partial output or
EAGAIN creates independent native queue segments. EPOLLOUT drains those segments
with `writev()` without first concatenating them in Perl.

Crossing `high_watermark` makes `write()` return false even though the bytes are
accepted. When pending bytes reach `low_watermark` or less, XS clears the
blocked state before calling `on_drain`, allowing reentrant writes to begin a
new backpressure interval safely.

`max_pending_bytes` is a separate optional safety policy. Zero means unlimited.
For a positive limit, XS checks the unsent remainder before allocating its
queue segment. If the resulting pending count would exceed the limit, Stream
does not queue the remainder, creates an `output_limit` error, calls `on_error`,
and closes. A direct kernel write may have sent a prefix before a partial result
reveals that the remainder is too large; the native queue itself never exceeds
the configured limit. The error records both the attempted `pending_bytes` and
the `limit`.

This does not change cooperative flow control. A false `write()` return still
means all bytes were accepted and `on_drain` will end that blocked interval.
Limit overflow is terminal and is distinguishable by its typed error.

`send($payload)` is framed-only. It applies the class's outbound built-in
encoding and then uses `write()`. Writable half-close also belongs to the
transport contract. Consequently `end()` expresses one lifecycle operation
whether a provider maps it to socket `shutdown(SHUT_WR)` or a multi-step TLS
close-notify exchange.

## Protocol transitions

`transition_to($class, input => $bytes)` changes the protocol type of a live
connection without reconstructing it. The Perl object is reblessed and its
native state swaps one retained class descriptor reference for another. These
connection-local resources remain unchanged:

- fd, filehandle, native registration, and XSState identity
- application `data`
- output segments, byte ordering, and pending byte count
- read pause, peer EOF, local half-close, and closed state
- native input storage and instrumentation counters

The target descriptor supplies subsequent callbacks, parser configuration,
read size, watermarks, hard output limit, input limit, and outbound `send()`
framing. Existing queued output is already encoded and remains unchanged.

Native input storage is deliberately retained. A framed-to-framed transition
reinterprets the unread suffix with the new native parser. A framed-to-raw
transition delivers that suffix as one raw chunk. Raw callbacks receive their
current kernel-read chunk directly, so they pass their unconsumed suffix with
`input => $bytes`; it is appended after any native suffix.

Every native parser snapshots its descriptor before invoking `on_message`. If
the callback transitions, that parser returns immediately. The input driver
then resumes under the new descriptor without issuing another `read()`. This
prevents old parser constants from being used after a reentrant descriptor
swap and supports clients that pipeline new-protocol bytes with an upgrade
request.

Transition validation and replacement are atomic. The new raw scratch buffer
and optional preserved-input storage are allocated before live state changes.
The target `max_buffer` is checked against existing plus explicit input. A
nonzero target `max_pending_bytes` is also checked against existing queued
output. On failure, the old Perl type, descriptor, and buffers remain active.

When called during `on_data` or `on_message`, target input callbacks are delayed
until the old callback returns; callers should return immediately after the
transition. Outside input dispatch, already-complete target input may be
delivered before `transition_to()` returns. Pause state always gates delivery.

## Lifecycle

- `pause_read` and `resume_read` change input interest while preserving state.
- Peer EOF marks the readable half closed and invokes `on_eof` once.
- `end` drains queued output before `shutdown(SHUT_WR)`.
- The Stream closes automatically after both halves have ended.
- `close` cancels immediately and may discard queued output.
- `detach` cancels Stream ownership and returns the still-open filehandle;
  `on_close` does not run because the resource was not closed.
- `transition_to` changes protocol behavior while preserving ownership and
  connection-local lifecycle state.
- `transport`, `transport_name`, and `is_transport_ready` expose provider
  identity and asynchronous setup state (`plain` is immediately ready).
- I/O, framing, and hard output-limit failures create
  `Linux::Event::Error`, invoke
  `on_error` if present, and close.

Application callback exceptions propagate. They are not treated as transport
or framing errors.

## Class transport policy

`stream_options` may return a key/value list or hash reference:

```perl
sub stream_options ($class) {
    return {
        read_size         => 65_536,
        high_watermark    => 1_048_576,
        low_watermark     => 262_144,
        max_pending_bytes => 0,
        max_buffer        => 8_388_608,
    };
}
```

It runs once per concrete subclass. Unknown options, invalid integers, and a low
watermark above the high watermark fail before connection registration. The
hard output limit is a non-negative byte count; zero disables it.

## Framing policy

Native framing is declared by exact package name. No keyword registry, factory
object, arbitrary `next_frame` object, or Buffer facade exists. This keeps the
hot model singular: built-ins are native; application-specific rules use raw
`on_data`.

A generally useful new family should add a named module and corresponding XS
parser mode. The naming convention lets the loader find that package without a
second list.

## Performance consequences

The redesign improves construction and retained memory by moving immutable work
from every object to one class descriptor. It removes per-connection callback
hash entries, framer allocation, option parsing, repeated validation, and
copies of native transport/framing configuration. Named callbacks also avoid
fresh closure allocation and are invoked through cached CVs rather than method
lookup.

It does not remove the intentional Perl crossing for semantic `on_data` or
`on_message` work. It also does not make application state global: `data`, input
storage, parser progress, output, and lifecycle remain connection-local.

Use `bench/run-stream-lifecycle-bench.pl` for constructor and retained-memory
effects, `bench/run-stream-microbench.pl` for raw transport overhead and the
cost of enabling a hard output limit, and the framing benchmarks for parser
work.

The provider contract and the bundled TLS implementation are specified in
`TRANSPORT-BOUNDARY.md`.
